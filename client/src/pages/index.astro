  <h2>About the Saudi Cyberfeminist Visual Index (SCFVI)</h2>
  <p>
    The Saudi Cyberfeminist Visual Index (SCFVI) is an open-source, web-based
    platform developed as part of an academic study. Rooted in feminist digital
    indexing practices and Saudi feminist ethics, the SCFVI serves as an
    interactive and searchable digital index documenting the Saudi Cyberfeminist
    Movement (SCM) from 2011 to 2021 and its continuing impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Focusing on two pivotal campaigns —
    <span class="bold">#EndMaleGuardianship</span> and
    <span class="bold">#Women2Drive</span> — the SCFVI captures the narratives, strategies,
    and achievements of these landmark movements. By indexing social media posts,
    blog entries, images, and videos, the SCFVI safeguards these ephemeral materials
    from digital erasure while preserving the legacy of Saudi cyberfeminism.
  </p>
  <p>
    The SCFVI is more than an archive; it is a living, dynamic resource designed
    to function as a historical record, a pedagogical tool, and a reference for
    scholars, artists, and activists. By preserving the contributions of Saudi
    cyberfeminists, it enhances global understanding of digital feminist
    activism while emphasizing the intersection of gender, technology, and
    culture in Saudi Arabia.
